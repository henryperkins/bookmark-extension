# Icons

You need to provide three icon files for the extension:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Quick Setup

You can:

1. Use an online icon generator (search "extension icon generator")
2. Create your own icons with any image editor
3. Use placeholder icons temporarily

## Temporary Placeholder

For testing, you can use any PNG images. Just rename them to match the required names above.

A simple bookmark/star/folder icon works well for a bookmark manager extension.

## Recommended Design

- Simple, recognizable symbol (bookmark, star, folder, checkmark)
- High contrast colors
- Clean lines that scale well
- Background color that stands out in the toolbar
